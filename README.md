# Stopwords Cleaner: A Simple NLP Pipeline for Text Preprocessing

This project demonstrates a fundamental natural language processing (NLP) task: removing stopwords from a text file. It's designed as a beginner-friendly introduction to text preprocessing and showcases how Python, NLTK, and a few simple techniques can clean and prepare textual data for analysis.

## Project Highlights
- Tokenizes raw text into individual words.
- Removes English stopwords using the NLTK library.
- Processes any .txt file, providing cleaned tokens ready for further NLP tasks.
- Modular and reusable Python code.

## Features
- **Text Tokenization** : Breaking down the raw text into individual tokens (words).
- **Stopword Removal** : Eliminating common words like "and," "the," or "is" to focus on meaningful content.
